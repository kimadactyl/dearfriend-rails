Dear Mary Wollenstonecraft-Shelley,

Thank you for being brave and creative. I can't say that I loved reading Frankenstein, but I love the fact that you wrote it when you were 18 and travelling the world with your new husband (the husband is not important) - you used your imagination to basically construct and entire genre! Your influences are everywhere now, and I have no doubt you inspired a huge number of young women to write (against the odds of being published as a woman).

Thank you,

Felicity
