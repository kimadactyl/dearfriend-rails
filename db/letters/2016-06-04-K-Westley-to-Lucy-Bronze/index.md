Dear Lucy

I think it is brilliant to see women making a success of a sport that has always been a man's world.

You scored a wonderful goal for England in the world cup.

You have shown some of your colleagues in the Manchester City men's team how to defend well.

All power to your boots.

From Keith Westley
To Lucy Bronze
