Dear Auntie May & Auntie Violet,

I think you were very brave. When your parents died you were 14 & you had two younger brothers. You worked in the local Peek Freans biscuit factory in Bermondsey.

Your brothers were going to be sent to an orphanage but you campaigned & went to the local papers to stop this happening. How brave this was - and successful.

There were no mobile phones, facebook, twitter, or other sites to drum up support, but you managed.

J.D.C.
