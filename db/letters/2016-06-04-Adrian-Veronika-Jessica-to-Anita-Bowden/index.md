Dear Anita, 

You have been with us ever since our first day at Solden. We learnt so may things from you. You have always been patient and inspirational. We respect you for everything you have done for Solden and the passion you have for working with people. You are a strong woman who always keeps her head up, whatever may happen. Thank you for being such a good friend. We know that we can always talk to you and this is a big help during our time far away from home. Anita, you will always be remembered as a very special part of our year abroad. 

All the best, 

Adrian, Veronkia and Jessica
