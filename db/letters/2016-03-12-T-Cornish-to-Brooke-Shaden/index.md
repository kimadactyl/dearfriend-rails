Dear Brooke Shaden,

I'm writing to you as part of a project aimed at recognising inspirational women. Your work has inspired me to start my own journey in photography -- I began to believe in my own ability to create after seeing your videos.

I'm excited to follow your journey, wherever it takes you. Best of luck in your future endeavours!

Thanks for being unafraid of being yourself and teaching others how to be the same. 

Tom Cornish
