Mary Barbour, 

They thought that your femininity meant weakness you would be 'easy', 'compliant' and put up with paying more for the damp and the broken taps and the gaps that let the wind in. Boy did they regret that. Your anger connected you to other women and you found strength in your connection and your anger. You pelted the police and let the whole of Scotland know that you ' were not removing.'
