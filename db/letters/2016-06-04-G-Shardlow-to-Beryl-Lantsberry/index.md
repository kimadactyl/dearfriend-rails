Dear Beryl,

You have always been such an inspiration to me. I would like to have your kindness, patience, and humour. When I think of everything you have done in your 99 years I am left awestruck. I am fascinated by your life & love it when you tell stories of the past. You make me laugh so much. If I become half the person you are I'll be very happy.

Gemma.
